AWS Lambda Adapters
=============
Ready-use adapters (resolvers and body parsers) for AWS Lambda Proxy integration


AWS Lambda Proxy integration in API gateway on AWS has structure for getting request and returning response. However, this structure needs some ready-use adapters to parse body and return response. AWS Lambda adapters are here!

For better performance, you must use "**Use Lambda Proxy integration**" for your dependent API gateway with lambda function.

## Installing

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install aws-lambda-adapters
```
